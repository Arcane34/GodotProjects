# Topdown

This is a basic topdown rpg I've made with imported assets to understand how the engine works. It handles the animation of a player character
and the collision between obstacles and the player where I also experimented with tilemaps and differences in the z_index of obstacles.
Lastly, it also allowed me to understand the basic movement that Godot supports in a 2 dimensional environment.

Here is a preview of the project:
